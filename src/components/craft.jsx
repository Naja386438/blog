          <p>Art and craft provide a platform for the artists for expressing their ideas and talents. We generally write or speak to others if we want to convey any message or talk about something.
             Have you ever thought that art and craft is another best way of conveying our message without speaking or writing? Many times we might have noticed that there are some of the paintings or crafts that try to convey to us some of the important messages. 
            Therefore, it can be stated that we can also convey our feelings by utilizing the power of art and craft. Art and craft have been prevalent in different cultures and skills are being modified along with the changing time and technology. 
            It is an important subject in the school and college curriculum of students. Moreover, it also helps in all-around development of the students.
